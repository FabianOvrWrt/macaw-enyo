This is the jsOAuth library: https://github.com/bytespider/jsOAuth

This library has been modified as needed for use in the macaw-enyo project:
	-	Added an option to force a request to be sent as multipart/form-data
		even if there are no files.

	-	Automatically remove a $ and any data following it from field names to
		allow multiple fields with the same name.
